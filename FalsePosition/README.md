# This function finds the roots of a inputed function using the false
# position method 
#
# The user inputs:
# func - the function being evaluted
# xl - the lower guess
# xu - the upper guess
# es - the desired relative error
# maxiter - the number of iterations desired
#
# The function outputs:
# root - the estimated root location
# fx - the function evaluted at the root location
# ea - the approximate relative error (%)
# iter - how many iterations were performed
