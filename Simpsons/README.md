% This function finds the integral when given tabular data using the 1/3 \n
% Simpson Rule of the first segments and all of them if the length of x and \n
% y are odd and the Trapezoidal Rule of the last segment only when the \n
% number of x and y inputs are even. \n
% Inputs: \n
% X = X-values in vector form \n
% Y = Y-values in vector form \n
% Outputs: \n
% I = Estimated Integral \n
