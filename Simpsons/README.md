# This function finds the integral when given tabular data using the 1/3
# Simpson Rule of the first segments and all of them if the length of x and
# y are odd and the Trapezoidal Rule of the last segment only when the
# number of x and y inputs are even.
# Inputs:
# X = X-values in vector form
# Y = Y-values in vector form
# Outputs:
# I = Estimated Integral
